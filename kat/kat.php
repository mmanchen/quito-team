      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Rochester, studying to get my BA in Digital Media Studies. I have lived in Rochester my whole life, and have enjoyed going to a school in a city that I am familiar with. The elementary school that I went to was expeditionary learning based, which I think helped me to value practical and hands-on education from a young age. My high school was fortunate enough to have arts based majors for the students, and there I studied Theater Technology, which continued the same opportunities of physical learning. Included in that were some classes for lighting and sound design, CAD programming, and PhotoShop skills. I think these experiences have all translated really well into the DMS major, which has a lot of project based elements, and real word influences.</p>
