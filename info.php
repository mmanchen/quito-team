		<p>Studying the origins and development of technology is an interesting contrast to most of the DMS courses, which direct more towards its present and future uses in society. As I progress through this major, it's exciting to be able to move beyond the introductory courses and choose others that are unique to the topics that I am interested in. This semester I will be taking The Art of Film and Modern Architecture, both of which are subjects that are very new to me, but I am eager to learn more about. I am also continuing this CSC web development series, after taking CSC 170 last spring, and although I do not intend on pursuing computer science as a career, I think the fundamental skills learned are invaluable as the world becomes more digitized and driven by technology.

		<p>It wasn’t until I got into university and took CSC 170 during my first year that I realized the importance of the code that I was messing with when changing the numbers and letters from the Tumblr blog themes. I was very interested in the class and was thoroughly excited to learn as much as I could while taking the course. I could also see the career path that I could follow if I were to gain more knowledge in the area of creating websites. But I soon realized that I wanted to do more. I realized the potential that the digital could have for my creativity. And that pretty much explains why I am now a Digital Media Studies major. It’s where I can get to show my skills and learn more about all things digital and to keep on doing my own kind of digital composition of turning the ideas that I have in my head into digital pieces.

		<p>My love for numbers and making a change in the world has resulted in me taking an interest in Business, Computer Science & Robotics. During my Junior year, I went to study abroad in Shanghai, China which was a life changing experience. Aside from the great food that I enjoyed, I got a chance to put my python programming skills into practice. I worked with a startup called, MIRO AI - a sports AI company. They focused on image processing of athletes in marathons. It is through this experience I got a chance to learn more about Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence & the power of Big Data. From then on, my life has never been the same again. I am always looking for opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills in the Data & the Technology sector. The language I am getting fluent at: python, statistics, machine learning and databases. My hope is that I can work work with numerous companies who have access to large data so that I can do what I do best ~ organize it, analyze it & interpret it to derive the best value.
