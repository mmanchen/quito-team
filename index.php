         <h1>Odd Student Out: Two DMS, One CS</h1>
         <h2>We have two DMS majors in Kat and Jennifer. We have one CS major in Dewey. What makes them different?</h2>
         <p>The University of Rochester has both majors. Our DMS major focuses on an interdisciplinary approach to the liberal arts, a tradition of expertise in imagining and entrepreneurship, and a University-wide commitment to supporting digital technology and the arts. Our CS major focuses on giving students a solid and rigorous background in computer science principles including the requisite mathematical foundations and to expose students to the problems and solution techniques used in the various areas of the discipline.</p>

         <p>Kat believes her major is important as the "world becomes more digitized and driven by technology." Jennifer finds her major fascinating because it is the "composition of turning the ideas that she has in her head into digital pieces." Dewey thinks his major allows people to "work holistically as humans to advance in technology." Learn more about them by clicking on their names.</p>
