# Domain

	This website is made up of two DMS majors and one CS major (Kat and Jen). The CS major is the "odd one out" (Dewey). Each major will get a background paragraph which is a short description of the person and why they chose their major.

# Choreography

	The website will have a Home page that will link to the two DMS majors and the one CS major. The Home page will use the Z-pattern. There will be a "Learn More" link on the Home Page. Once that is clicked, it will take you to a page with the F-pattern of all the majors and why they chose their perspective majors.
	
# Designer's notes: 
	
	This website is structured to follow Guternberg's rules. The home page follows the z-pattern by placing the logo on the top-left (the primary visual focus), followed by the theme of the page on the top-right (the strong visual focus). The z-pattern continues diagonally throught the main part of the homepage or big-text, where the title of the website is discloused. At the end of the diagonal we can find a hint of what the user will learn more about if they continue onto the next page, which serves as a hook (the weak visual focus) and finally, on the bottom-right part of the page (the terminal visual focus), we find a navigation element enclosed in a pink box to draw your attention which will direct you to the main page where you can learn more about the 'Odd Student Out'.
	The main page or sub-page was implemented with f-pattern. The page consists of a fixed navigation header, in which the title is a navigation element to go back to the home page. This header mimics the important elements of the theme of the home page. Moreover, the page is designed to emmanate the Ecuador flag. Event the yellow fixed header is thoughtout to complement the design, and create a second Ecuador flag when the reader scrolls down to read the bottom section. As mentioned by the IA, the 'Odd Student Out' is Dewey since he is a CS major and the other two are DMS. 
	Hope you enjoyed the visual experince :) !
